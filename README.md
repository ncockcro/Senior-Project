# Senior-Project

For my Computer Science capstone, I decided to recreate the popular educational game *Oregon Trail*! This is a semester long project where I am demonstrating a lot of the knowledge and information that I have gained during my time at Ramapo College of New Jersey. This game is written in C++ and was built using Visual Studio as the developing environment. 

### Oregon Trail

Oregon Trail was originally developed in 1971 by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger. At the time, it was a simple text based strategy game that was designed to teach kids about the 19th century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The game garnered massive success in the 70s and 80s and would go on to be one of the most historic games in gaming history. There have been several iterations of the game since then, spanning many different platforms, including mobile. My version of Oregon Trai will be sticking closely to the earlier versions of the game as well as adding a few more modern features such as leaderboards, a ranking system, along with a store where players are able to purchase useful items.

### Setup
When the game first boots up, players are greated by a welcome screen with several options, this is the main menu.  Users can start a new game, get a description of what the game is about, check the leaderboards, go to the store, and exit the application. 

### Leaderboard
The leaderboard is accessible through the main menu and when chosen, will display the top 10 players who have played locally on the machine that the game is played on.
